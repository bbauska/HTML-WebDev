# webdev-html
This HTML course for web developers provides a solid overview for developers, from novice to expert level HTML.

HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the standard markup language for describing the structure of documents displayed on the web. HTML consists of a series of elements and attributes which are used to mark up all the components of a document to structure it in a meaningful way.

HTML documents are basically a tree of nodes, including HTML elements and text nodes. HTML elements provide the semantics and formatting for documents, including creating paragraphs, lists and tables, and embedding images and form controls. Each element may have multiple attributes specified. Many elements can have content, including other elements and text. Other elements are empty, with the tag and attributes defining their function.

There are several categories of elements, including 
  - metadata, 
  - sectioning, 
  - text, 
  - inline semantic, 
  - form, 
  - interactive, 
  - media, 
  - component, and 
  - scripting. 

We'll cover most of these in the series. But first, what is an element?

## Elements
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;).

Our page title is a heading, level one, for which we use the &lt;h1&gt; tag. The actual title, "Machine Learning Workshop", is the content of our element. The content goes between the open and closing tags. The entire thing—the opening tag, closing tag, and the content—is the element.
